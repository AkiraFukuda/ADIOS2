Introduce coding guidelines that all developers must follow as standard practice.     

Objectives:

1) Improve collaboration:
	1.a. Reduce new code development and integration times for developers and users, by making code easy to understand
	1.b. Allocate more time for discussion and pathfinding rather than understanding developers code
	1.c. Expand developers and users base
	
2) Execute new ideas faster  

3) Allocate more time to research and publication from new ideas
